# TacklingNephrotic-
app to help parents/caretaker to tackle nephrotic syndrome of their kids. 

Nephrotic Syndrome 
In this disease patient leaks too much protein in urine which is bad for patient health. Caretaker/parents needs to test urine of patient on daily basis using dipstick (urine dipstick) and needs to log the result in notebook which after few months becomes cumbersome. Caretaker/ parents needs to record not only Urine result but also other details about patient like diseases, medicine, sideEffects. So, to solve this issue, I am creating this app. 
One more thing which other apps lack is the experience. My kid has nephrtoic syndrome and I am having same issue as described above. This app will help parents like me. 

Symptoms
1) Edema - Swelling of arms , legs and eyes
2) Weight Gain
3) Loss of appetite

There are three states under which a patient goes during nephrotic Syndrome.
1. Remission - A state where patient shows no symptoms or symptoms are under control.
2. Relapse - A state where symptoms returns
3. Maintenance - A state between remission and relapse.

Results of Dipstick
1) Negative - 0mg of proteinuria per decilitre of urine (mg/dL)
2) trace  - 15 to 30 mg/dL
3) 1+ - 30 to 100 mg/dL
4) 2+ - 100 to 300 mg/dL
5) 3+ - 300 to 1000 mg/dL
6) 4+ - more than 1000 mg/dL

More on Relapse State -> 
If the dipstick result shows 3+ or more of protein in the urine for 3 days in a row, this means patient is in relapse state. In this state, patient needs to take medicine (steroids) or consult doctor.
